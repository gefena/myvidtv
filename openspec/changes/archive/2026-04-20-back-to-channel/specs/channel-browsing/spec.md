## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Channel browse modal
Clicking a channel card SHALL open a modal overlay that fetches and displays the channel's most recent videos via YouTube's public RSS feed (`https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id={channelId}`). The modal SHALL show video title, thumbnail, and published date for each entry. The RSS feed provides approximately 15 most recent videos. The modal SHALL always open from the top of the list (no scroll state is preserved between openings). The modal MAY be triggered from sources other than a channel card click (e.g. a back-to-channel affordance in the player) — it SHALL behave identically regardless of trigger.

#### Scenario: Browse modal opens and loads videos
- **WHEN** the user clicks a channel card
- **THEN** the channel browse modal opens and fetches the RSS feed, displaying the list of recent videos from the top

#### Scenario: Browse modal reopened from player back-to-channel affordance
- **WHEN** the user activates the back-to-channel control while a channel video is playing
- **THEN** the channel browse modal opens for the source channel, fetching fresh data from the top of the list

#### Scenario: Video selected for playback
- **WHEN** the user clicks a video in the channel browse modal
- **THEN** the video begins playing in the player and the modal closes; the video is NOT added to the library

#### Scenario: RSS fetch fails
- **WHEN** the RSS feed cannot be fetched
- **THEN** the modal displays an error message and offers a retry option
